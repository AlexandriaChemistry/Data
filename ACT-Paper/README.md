# Data to reproduce results from the ACT paper

## MolProps - molecule property files
Here you find the results from quantum calculations for monomers and dimers at the MP2/aug-cc-pvtz sapt2+(ccd)dmp2/aug-cc-pvtz levels of theory respectively. The data is in XML format that can be read by the ACT or, for instance, by your own Python scripts.

## FF_ACT
Here you find the four force fields for the simulations in Fig. 4 and table S8-S11. The force fields are in XML format ready to be processed by the ACT.

## GROMACS_OPLS
Here you find GROMACS style topologies needed to perform OPLS simulations in GROMACS of the results presented in Fig. 4 and table S8-S10.

## FF_OpenMM
FF files that were converted files from ACT to OpenMM format also in XML.

## Selection
Text files that list the compounds used for Figs. 3 and 4 in the paper.

## PDB
Condensed phase simulation boxes for all systems presented in the paper, including SI.

## Scripts
Here are two script to reproduce figures from the ACT paper.
You need a working installation of the ACT to run the scripts.
