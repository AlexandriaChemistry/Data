+ Fit_ESP-4models.py computes the electrostatic potential for each ion and determines the parameters for each charge model.

+ Electrostatic_4models.py can be used to calculate the electrostatic interactions for each model and to plot the SAPT0 electrostatics for the interactions between each ion pair.
