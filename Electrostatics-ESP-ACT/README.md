# Beyond Partitioning: Using Force Field Science to Evaluate Electrostatics Models
Scripts, force field files for widely-used and Alexandria force fields
(only electrostatic part), and electrostatic potential (ESP) fitting for reproducing results in the scientific article
[_Accurate Electrostatics for Biomolecular Systems through Machine Learning_].
Here's an oldish [preprint](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/67f82e8e81d2151a02e49d35)

Please check README files in the subdirectories as well.

If you find our scripts or data useful, we would greatly appreciate it if you cite our work and consider starring the repository.

## Directory Layout

- `AnalyticalFitting/` - Analytical fitting for the quantum chemical ESP and electrostatic calculations for different charge models, e.g. a (positive) point charge with either one Gaussian or 1S Slater distributed charge, or a
   point charge with two Gaussian charges or a point charge with a 1S and a 2S Slater charge.
- `AnalyticalFitting/SAPT_Alkali_Halides/` - SAPT0/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations.
- `AntechamberGaussian/` - BCC and RESP calculations from Gaussian and Antechamber for ions, water, and side-chains.
- `Charge_Models/` - Reproduction of Tables and figures, comparison of electrostatic energies from Alexandria and other popular charge models, e.g. ESP.  Reproduction of partial charges- Tables S9-S14.
- `Scripts4Figs/` - Reproduction of the figure 2B,S2 presented in the article.
- `AlexandriaFF/` - Trained force field files on SAPT2+(CCD)-Î´MP2 using Alexandria.esp-paper-gaussian.xml FF contains charges for Mulliken, Hirshfeld, CM5, and ESP.
- `ForceFields/` - Available force field files such as TIP3P, TIP4P, TIP4P-2005.xml, TIP4PEW-JC.xml, Walz2018a.xml, GAFF, and SWM4-NDP.xml. 
- `Selection/` - Train and Test sets and a script to generate random test and train compounds. 
- `Scripts4Tabs/` - Reproduction of tables presented in the article.
- `Parameters` -  Parameters for the PC, GC, PC+GV, and PC+GS  models trained on the electrostatic energy or the sum of electrostatic and induction energies from SAPT2+(CCD)-dMP2. For details please see the ACT manual.
- `ESP-RMSD-Histogram/` - ESP at the HF/6-31G** level of theory for 5100 compounds, Fig S1.

## Requirements

- To run the scripts, you'll need Python installed on your computer, if you want to run on your own computer,
install python using e.g. [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://docs.conda.io)).

- To be able to run analyses, you need to install [Alexandria Chemistry Toolkit](https://github.com/AlexandriaChemistry/ACT).
