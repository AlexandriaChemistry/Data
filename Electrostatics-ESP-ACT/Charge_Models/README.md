# Scripts for tables and figures

Charge-Models-Table1.py script generates a table containing the RMSD values for the Mulliken, Hirshfeld, ESP, CM5, BCC, RESP, and ACT models, compared to SAPT2+(CCD)$\delta$MP2 using the aug-cc-pVTZ basis set for water ions and side chain analogs.

PartialCharges.py extracts partial charges for compounds from log files and geneates a LaTeX table.

RMSD-Compounds.py generates a table of RMSD for important methods and also heatmaps for all RMSDs plotted in a matrix.

Residual4Induction.py plots the residual of the induction for water and ions.

plot-coulomb-train.sh plots residuals of the electrostatics for all methods.
